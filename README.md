# Visualization of Alzheimer's Disease
Visualizing Current and Future Impact of Alzheimer’s Disease(AD) [Link](https://zishanfu.github.io/Visualization-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease/index.html)

### Visualization Objectives :moneybag:
* Target Audience
    * Federal and State Government
    * General tax payer population
    
* Explore emotional impact of AD via caregiver blogs

* Exploratory data analysis
    * United States AD Population Data
    * United States AD Spending Cost Data
    * United States Population Data (census)
    
* Predictive insights
    * Future United States AD Population Data
    * Future United States AD Related Health Spending Data
    * States that are impacted the most in terms of health spending and AD population

### Summary and Explaination
:boom: Overview: Interactive Multivariate Bubble Chart  
When the mouse is over the bubble, the information of AD numbers, costs in AD, slope and health spending will be display. Chart can be zoom in by mouse and be filter by the scroll bar below the chart.  

:question: How to get insights from those charts:confused:   
> See hints here!:point_down:
> 1. For each state, its location on the x-axis indicates its AD population, the y-axis indicates how much health spending on AD in millions, the size of the circle indicates total health spending for the state. Additionally we also use color as a visual variable to show groups of states. This can be done using their geographical location such as east, west, and central. The data can be observed over time using the interactive slider at the bottom.  
> 2. Relationship between spending cost and AD number: The slope shows the readiness of state for AD. Eg, Az has lowest slope but choropleth map show projected AZ AD prevalence increase is the most.  
> 3.West coast is highest risk area since the slope distribution is not consistent. Suggestion for West coast government is to pay more attention to AD.  
> 4. Looking at the total healthcare spending (circle size). You can see that CA and FL have similar AD number and AD spending cost, but total health spending is very different. This suggests that FL government should increase budget for health spending.  
> 5. If you use the scroll bar, you will see that New York AD number slightly increases, but their spending cost sharply increases suggesting that New York government can reduce AD spending.

:boom: Choropleth Maps  
This map shows projected increase of AD prevalence by state from 2016 to 2025. We can more readily observe the clusters of neighboring states that share similar projected AD prevalence. This immediately gives you a good idea of states to target for increasing healthcare spending to support AD caregiving. Hovering above the states give you the exact increase percentage as well as actual projected AD prevalence data.

:boom: Interaction Graph  
Interaction Graph combines choropleth map and bubble chart. You can not only use zoom and filter manipulate the graph, but also can select state and year combination to see more information.

:boom: Facts Graph  
This is the facts section of our visualization which is meant to provide the user with quick facts.  
On the left is the Wordle created by Joena using care giver’s blog. We can see words describing symptoms of AD appearing frequently along with “caregiving” “worsen” “daily”.  
On the right we show estimated lifetime risks of AD by age and gender. You can see that women are at higher risk than men across all three ages.

:boom: Stream Graph  
For Exploring the current and projected AD population data and Caregiving Cost Data, we use a stream graph layout. We can look at state population data from the US census projections, filtered by age to include only 65 & and above, over time. The black lines mark key points for the baby boomer generations. 2011 is when the first baby boomers begin retiring and 2029 is when all the baby boomers reach retirement age. We can also switch to projected healthcare spending cost data set. We can also filter and zoom based on clustering of data to reduce the cluttering.
