# Visualization of Alzheimer's Disease
Visualizing Current and Future Impact of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease(AD)

### Visualization Objectives
* Target Audience
    * Federal and State Government
    * General tax payer population

* Explore emotional impact of AD via caregiver blogs

* Exploratory data analysis
    * United States AD Population Data
    * United States AD Spending Cost Data
    * United States Population Data (census)

* Predictive insights
    * Future United States AD Population Data
    * Future United States AD Related Health Spending Data
    * States that are impacted the most in terms of health spending and AD population

### Summary and Explaination
Overview: Interactive Multivariate Bubble Chart  
When the mouse is over the bubble, the information of AD numbers, costs in AD, slope and health spending will be display. Chart can be zoom in by mouse and be filter by the scroll bar below the chart.  
:question: How to get insights from this chart?  
Here some hints~  
> For each state, its location on the x-axis indicates its AD population, the y-axis indicates how much health spending on AD in millions, the size of the circle indicates total health spending for the state. Additionally we also use color as a visual variable to show groups of states. This can be done using their geographical location such as east, west, and central. The data can be observed over time using the interactive slider at the bottom.  
Relationship between spending cost and AD number: The slope shows the readiness of state for AD. Eg, Az has lowest slope but previous choropleth map show projected AZ AD prevalence increase is the most.  
West coast is highest risk area since the slope distribution is not consistent. Suggestion for West coast government is to pay more attention to AD.  
Looking at the total healthcare spending (circle size). You can see that CA and FL have similar AD number and AD spending cost, but total health spending is very different. This suggests that FL government should increase budget for health spending.  
If you use the scroll bar, you will see that New York AD number slightly increases, but their spending cost sharply increases suggesting that New York government can reduce AD spending.
